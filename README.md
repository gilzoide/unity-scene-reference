# Stable Scene Reference
Autogenerated `ScriptableObject`s that are stable references to the scenes configured in Unity Build Settings.


## Features
- Scene references are automatically generated/refreshed whenever the scenes in Build Settings change or any scene is renamed/moved, no code or manual setup required
- Scene references are stable and based on their GUID: if a scene is renamed/moved, all existing references to the corresponding `SceneReference` are maintained
- No extra files are created in your project: everything lives in the asset imported from an empty file that lives in the package's own folder
- Utility methods `SceneReference.Load`, `SceneReference.LoadAsync` and `SceneReference.UnloadAsync` to load/unload scenes directly from references


## Caveats
- Only Scenes enabled in Build Settings are generated
  + Referencing scenes that are not in Build Settings is not supported at all
  + If you have multiple build configurations that involve changing which Scenes are enabled, previous references to disabled ones will be missing from the build and will be `null` at runtime


## How to install
Install via [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) using the following URL:
```
https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-scene-reference.git
```


## How to use
1. Declare [SceneReference](Runtime/SceneReference.cs) fields in your scripts
2. Use the Inspector to assign any of the `SceneReference`s automatically generated from your project's Build Settings
3. Use `SceneReference.Load`, `SceneReference.LoadAsync` and `SceneReference.UnloadAsync` to load/unload scenes.
   Alternatively, use `SceneReference.BuildIndex` or `SceneReference.Path` as argument to [SceneManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.html) load/unload methods.
4. Enjoy üçæ
