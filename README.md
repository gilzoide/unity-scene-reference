# Scene Reference
Autogenerated `ScriptableObject`s that are stable references to the scenes configured in Unity Build Settings.


## Features
- Everything is automatically generated by the scripts, no action is required from users
- Scene references are refreshed whenever your scenes in Build Settings change or any scene is renamed/moved
- No extra files are created in your project: everything lives in the asset imported from an empty file that lives in the package's own folder
- Scene references are stable and based on their GUID: if a scene is renamed/moved, all references to the corresponding `SceneReference` are maintained


## How to install
Install via [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) using the following URL:
```
https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-scene-reference.git

## How to use
1. Declare `SceneReference` fields in your scripts
2. Use the Inspector to assign any of the `SceneReference`s automatically generated from your project's Build Settings
